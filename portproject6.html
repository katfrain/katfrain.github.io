				<h2>portfolio website</h2><br>
				<h3><b> Medium: </b><i>HTML, CSS, VS Code, Figma</i><br><br>This website was the biggest challenge for me within this portfolio. Before beginning this project I had no prior experience in coding. I started learning the fundamentals by taking the HTML and CSS course on <a class="links" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp.org</a>. After completing it, I was still intimidated by the idea of starting this webpage, but once I started writing, I realized it was not as scary as it seemed. That’s not to say it was an easy task. I had to push through countless headaches trying to figure out why something was, or was not, showing up on my page.
														<br><br>I started by creating a mock-up of what I wanted each page to look like in Figma and then used that design to start coding in VS Code. This process took plenty of problem-solving and plenty of google searches to understand which tag does what. I created an “About Me” page and a “Contact” page as an extra challenge. Unfortunately, the contact page isn't fully functional (as in it does not send the data anywhere) But I wanted to experiment with using different types of input boxes. I don't believe that the final product is a masterpiece, nor is the final code the most organized and efficient. But it meets all the goals I set in place when designing it, and I am very proud of what I have created.
