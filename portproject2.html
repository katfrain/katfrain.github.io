				<h2>digital portrait</h2><br>
				<h3><b> Medium: </b><i>Krita</i><br><br>When I got my first drawing tablet, I opened Krita on my computer and attempted to paint a portrait. Drawing and painting portraits on paper and canvas were familiar to me, and I assumed it would come naturally in the digital world as well. Quickly I realized how different these mediums were, and I would need to invest just as much time and effort learning to create digitally, as it did to learn traditionally. I don't believe this piece is perfect, but it's one I am very proud of. It taught me what types of brushes to use for different effects, and how to use tools specific to digital software to enhance the piece. I'm excited to further explore this medium and continue creating within it.</h3>
